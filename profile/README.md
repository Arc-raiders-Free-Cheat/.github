## Overview

**ARC Raiders** blends squad-based tactics, extraction tension, and sandbox encounters against an invading machine collective known as the ARC. You and your crew of Raiders scavenge derelict facilities, repel orbital drops, dismantle towering automatons, and ferry precious tech back to base. The world is a moody, analog-meets-neon future: CRT screens, tape decks, welded armor plates, and improvised coilguns stitched from scrap. Every expedition is a story of risk versus reward; every return to camp funds the next push into hostile territory.

---

## Core Pillars

- 🎯 **Co-op first:** Three-player fireteams with clear roles, quick pings, and intuitive revives keep momentum high even in chaotic firefights.  
- 🧠 **Tactical sandbox:** Outthink patrol routes, exploit weak points, chain gadgets, and trigger environmental hazards to turn steel giants into salvage.  
- 📦 **Extraction pressure:** Pack light for speed or heavy for firepower. Evac windows are brief, and ARC responses escalate if you linger.  
- 🌧 **Living battlefield:** Dynamic weather, day/night cycles, signal interference, and orbital drop warnings reshape routes in real time.  
- 🛠 **Buildcraft freedom:** Assemble kits from found parts; mod weapons with barrels, rails, magazines, and experimental power cores.

---

## Combat & Enemy Design

ARC units are built to **counter sloppy play**. Drones scout, Hounds flank, Bulwarks pin positions with suppressive fire, and Colossi deploy shock pylons that deny cover. Raiders must break formations:
- **Disrupt sensors** with EMP darts, then **stack debuffs** via corrosive grenades.  
- **Focus joints** and heat vents; **overload shields** with sustained arc fire.  
- **Use verticality:** grapples, rooftops, gantries, and billboard catwalks amplify line-of-sight control.  
- **Chain crowd control:** net-traps into concussive mines into railgun finishers.

---

## Progression & Loadouts

- **Archetypes:**  
  **Vanguard** (frontline tank with shock baton and deployable barrier),  
  **Outrider** (scout with cloak burst and sensor sweep),  
  **Rigger** (engineer with turrets, nets, and remote dets).

- **Weapon families:** coil rifles, hand-built SMGs, slug shotguns, rail cannons, marksman kits, and launcher frames.  
- **Mod slots:** muzzle, optic, core, auxiliary; roll for stability, heat management, charge time, projectile conductivity, and crit windows.  
- **Gadgets:** zip-lines, field amps, signal jammers, decoy beacons, dome shields, auto-injectors, repair swarms.

---

## World & Activities

- **Arcfall Sites:** chase orbital signals; the longer you farm, the nastier the response waves.  
- **Relay Towers:** seize spectrum bands to unlock fast travel and map intel.  
- **Supply Trains:** moving objectives that force convoy ambushes.  
- **Vault Runs:** timed dungeons with rotating mutators (low-gravity, EMP storms, limited HUD).  
- **Hunter Bounties:** track elite ARC specimens across sectors; expect adaptations after each failed attempt.

---

## Economy & Crafting

Salvage fuels everything. Scraps turn into plates, plates into frames, frames into weapon bodies. Rare **Flux Cores** unlock exotic archetype abilities. Vendors rotate stock; contracts from Settlers award unique schematics. Crafting has **meaningful tradeoffs**: lighter receivers kick harder; stabilized cores reduce sway but increase overheat risk.

---

## Co-op Etiquette & Teamplay

- **Divide roles:** one looter, one escort, one overwatch.  
- **Share plates and med-stims** before boss pulls; status effects stack across teammates.  
- **Call arcs and arcs back:** communicate flank routes and fallback beacons.  
- **Evac discipline:** leave greed at the ramp; late evac wipes the whole haul.

---

## Performance & Settings

- **Input:** full gamepad and mouse support with per-slot sensitivity, independent ADS curves, and gyro toggles for supported devices.  
- **Video:** FSR/DLSS upscalers, frame gen for capable GPUs, granular post-FX toggles (film grain, chromatic aberration, vignettes).  
- **Audio:** HRTF positional mix, dynamic range presets, per-channel sliders for dialogue, effects, radio, and music.  
- **Accessibility:** subtitle size/color, color-blind palettes (Deuteranopia/Protanopia/Tritanopia), aim assist tiers, hold-to-toggle options, reduced flicker mode.

## Tips From The Field

1. **Listen for sky-sirens.** Orbital drops telegraph a direction; rotate to high ground before impact.  
2. **Carry one silence option.** Suppressed coil pistols keep patrol trees from branching into three engagements at once.  
3. **Bait the stomp.** Heavy ARC units overcommit to melee; roll through ankles and empty mags into exposed heatsinks.  
4. **EMP before nets.** Disabled targets can’t jump nets, and nets amplify shock damage.  
5. **Evac early, craft smarter.** Two small hauls outpace one greedy wipe.

---

## Getting Started

1. Install the game on your PC and complete the prologue at the Raider Camp.  
2. Form a squad of three, set roles, and test comms in the firing range.  
3. Accept a contract, tag an Arcfall signal, and gear for mobility first.  
4. Scout with binocs and pings; mark patrol paths and fallback alleys.  
5. Extract with what you can carry; use the workshop to tune your next build.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is solo play viable?**  
Yes, but ARC escalation assumes squads. Expect tighter ammo economy and more deliberate routes.

**Are raids instanced or open?**  
Sectors are session-based with reactive spawns and public events; Arcfall storms affect every team in that sector.

**How punishing is extraction failure?**  
You lose carried salvage and a portion of durability on equipped gear. Stored camp inventory remains safe.

**Are there seasonal resets?**  
Progression is persistent. Seasonal contracts and sector modifiers rotate without wiping your crafted kits.

---

## Known Issues & Workarounds

- **Shader stutter on first launch:** let the shader cache precompile at the title screen before matchmaking.  
- **Audio desync after alt-tab:** switch output device in the menu once to refresh streams.  
- **Invisible lasers in sandstorms:** enable “High” particle quality to restore beam rendering.

---

## Roadmap Snapshot

- New **ARC Titan** boss line with modular armor logic.  
- Expanded **relay tower** meta with cooperative uplink events.  
- Two weapon families: **microwave carbines** and **flechette revolvers**.  
- Advanced **camp fabrication** including transmog for crafted frames.

## Community Guidelines

Keep comms clear, mark resources, ping threats, and respect evac calls. Report exploit spots and geometry traps so they can be sealed in upcoming patches. The goal is a fair, tactical loop for every squad that enters a storm.
